### Alexa Skill: Next ferry times for SF Bay Ferry

***WARNING: Don't take this too seriously. It's a hobby project***

Next Transit Time is the API that powers the my-transit Alexa Skill. So far it can give time info for ferry schedules between San Francisco Ferry Building, Pier 41, Alameda and Oakland Jack London Square terminal. Will extend that in the future to support more terminals. 

Caveats:
- All code as it is was written adhoc and requires refactoring and cleanup
- Extensible data representation is needed to make it easy to add more data
- Refactoring required to make it extensible
