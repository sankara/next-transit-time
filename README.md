### Alexa Skill: Next ferry times for SF Bay Ferry

***WARNING: Don't take this too seriously. It's a hobby project***

This is just a first cut. It works as in it gives the next ferry time assuming you are going from Oakland Jack London
to San Francisco. 

Pending:

- Extend to support all terminals (need to painstakingly type in the data)
- Add validation and dialog interaction to get the source and destination from Alexa
